This project was created with the purpose of informing those who are not familiar with tea. This website informs you about how tea first came into be and how it was developed into the world wide drink of choice. 

#How to naviage the site

The site implements a navbar which allows you to go through the different components of the site. 

In our About Page, you can learn how tea was first created and the different methods that were utilized to further the evolution and taste. It's rich history dates back all the way to China and through trade and commerce, it has become a main stay good in many countries. 

In the Teas page, you can browse through many different teas that will list a picture of the color, as well as the its taste and benefits. Tea is known for its various health benefits, and if you are looking for something particular such as "skin health" you can find that here!

In the Tea form page, since there are so many different subsets and varieties of tea with their own variatiions, I have included a tea form that allows people to share their favorite teas that might not be there! It is a simple form which incoporates a POST request and adds it to the list of the teas in the teas tab. 

# What this project incoporates
